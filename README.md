# Typeset-notes
 This is a repository organising my typeset notes for maths and physics in the Natural Sciences Tripos at University of Cambridge.  Most of the notes are best use as a short reference, since most derivation are skipped. I intend to use them during the intensive review period before the exam, so they may not be suitable for people with no prior exposure to the course.
